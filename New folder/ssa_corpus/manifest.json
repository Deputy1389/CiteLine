For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully recommend that Defendant's motion for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 12 ) be denied, and that Plaintiff's opposition (Dkt. 18) be construed as a cross-motion for judgment on the pleadings in his favor and, as such, be granted, insofar as Plaintiff seeks remand to the SSA for further proceedings. I further recommend  that, on remand, the ALJ be instructed: 1. to seek to develop the record by obtaining medical source statements from Drs. Monica Martin and Jose I. Rodriquez, Plaintiff's primary care physicians at All Med Medical and Rehabilitation Center, rega rding the extent to which Plaintiff's medical conditions resulted in impairments that, during the relevant period, affected his ability to perform work-related activities; 2. to consider the questionnaires completed by Dr. Themistocle that were  submitted by Plaintiff to the Appeals Council, along with the October 10, 2014 neurosurgery referral letter also submitted to the Appeals Council; and 3. to weigh all medical opinion evidence in accordance with the requirements of the treating physic ian rule. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the parties shall have fourteen (14) days from service of this Report and Recommendation to file written objections. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 6.  Such objections, and any responses to objections, shall be filed with the Clerk of Court, with courtesy copies delivered to the chambers of the Honorable Colleen McMahon, United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, Room 2550, New York, NY 10007, and  to the chambers of the undersigned, United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, Room 1660, New York, NY 10007. Any requests for an extension of time for filing objections should be directed to Judge McMahon. As Plaintiff is proceeding in this action  pro se, any submissions he makes to the Court (including any objections to this Report and Recommendation for filing, any courtesy copies for judges' chambers, and any requests for extensions of time) should be mailed or otherwise delivered by h im to the Court's Pro Se Office. FAILURE TO OBJECT WITHIN FOURTEEN (14) DAYS WILL RESULT IN A WAIYER OF OBJECTIONS AND WILL PRECLUDE APPELLATE REVIEW. See Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 155 (1985); IUE AFL-CIO Pension Fund v.

Specifically, the Court finds that 1)  the ALJ's decision to disregard the medical opinions of Dr. Ahmed, Dr.  Santarpia, and Dr. Echevarria did not constitute  legal error; 2)  the ALJ's decision to implicitly disregard the medical opinion of Dr. Tzetzo  consti tuted reversible legal error; 3)  the ALJ did not commit legal  error in conducting his residual functional capacity assessment or crafting his VE hypothetical,  neither of which included certain limitations the ALJ identified in steps two   a nd three of the sequential process for determining whether a claimant is  disabled; and 4)  the Appeals Council was required to consider the VA  decision,  which became part of the overall administrative record when Plaintiff submitted it as n ew evidence and the Appeals Council denied his request for review.  Accordingly,  the Court hereby REMANDS this case to the ALJ for further administrative proceedings  in order to determine, in  conjunction with considering the entire reco rd, the effect of Dr. Tzetzo's  medical opinion and the VA decision on Plaintiff's disability assessment.\"  (emt, )CERTIFICATE OF SERVICEParticipants registered to receive electronic notific ations received this document electronically at the e-mail address listed on the Notice of Electronic Filing (NEF).
