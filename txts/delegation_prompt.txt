You are taking over a refactor in C:\Citeline.

Goal:
Refactor apps/worker/steps/step12_export.py (currently ~4.2k lines) into modular files under apps/worker/steps/export_render/ while preserving behavior.

Hard constraints:
- Refactor only. Do not change output semantics.
- No scoring/threshold/business-rule edits.
- Keep backward-compatible API surface in step12_export.py.
- If any regression appears, revert that phase and retry with smaller extraction.

Current state already done:
- Litigation sections extracted to apps/worker/steps/litigation/render_sections.py.
- Projection orchestration extracted:
  - apps/worker/steps/export_render/projection_pipeline.py
- Markdown builder extracted:
  - apps/worker/steps/export_render/markdown_render.py
- step12_export.py already calls those modules.
- Tests and robustness currently pass.

Your tasks (in order):

1) Extract timeline/appendix PDF builders
- Move timeline-related builders from step12_export.py to:
  - apps/worker/steps/export_render/timeline_pdf.py
- Move appendix-related builders to:
  - apps/worker/steps/export_render/appendices_pdf.py
- Keep function signatures and call order unchanged.

2) Extract CSV and DOCX renderers
- Move CSV logic to:
  - apps/worker/steps/export_render/csv_render.py
- Move DOCX logic to:
  - apps/worker/steps/export_render/docx_render.py
- No behavior changes.

3) Extract export orchestration
- Move render orchestration internals to:
  - apps/worker/steps/export_render/orchestrator.py
- Keep step12_export.py exporting same callable names as compatibility wrappers.

4) Keep markdown integration intact
- Ensure build_markdown_bytes(...) is still used from markdown_render.py.
- Preserve chronology.md artifact.

5) Clean up imports/dead code
- Remove unused imports/functions from step12_export.py.
- Keep only thin wrappers + compatibility-facing functions.

Verification after each phase:
Run:
- python -m pytest tests/unit/test_export.py tests/unit/test_pipeline_litigation_extensions.py tests/unit/test_run_case_wiring.py -q
- python scripts/run_case.py --input PacketIntake/01_soft_tissue_easy/packet.pdf --case-id refactor_delegate_check --run-label refactor_delegate_check_01
- python scripts/eval_invariant_robustness.py --input-dir PacketIntake --sample-size 10 --seed 20260220 --output-json readiness/robustness_delegate_phase.json

Acceptance criteria:
- Tests pass.
- run_case returns successful payload (qa/legal/luqa/attorney pass unchanged for the sample).
- Robustness report shows:
  - overall_invariant_stable: true
  - material_changes: 0
  - determinism_failures: 0
- step12_export.py materially reduced in size and complexity.
- No public API break in modules importing from step12_export.py.

Deliverables:
- List of files changed.
- Brief before/after architecture summary.
- Validation command outputs summarized.
- Note any residual risks.
